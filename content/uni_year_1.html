<h2>Semester 1</h2>
<hr />
<div id="cem" class="section level3">
<h3>4000CEM</h3>
<p>Programming and Algorithms is the module that introduces Python 3 to
all. We had started to learn the bare minimum basics and then
immediately jumped to the higher level programming like mathematics in
Python. If you know anything about me, it’s a known fact that I despise
mathematics in programming so much. I don’t really have much that I can
show on this module since I had been doing Python 3 for the last 3 years
prior to this module starting. However, here is a snippet from the
course that we had to solve as part of a lab task:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def bubbleSort(array):
    n = len(array)
    while (n &gt; 0):
        lastModifiedIndex = 0
        currentIndex = 1
        while (currentIndex &lt; n):
            # if the item at the previous index is greater than the item at the `currentIndex`, swap them
            if (array[currentIndex - 1] &gt; array[currentIndex]):
                # swap
                temp = array[currentIndex - 1]
                array[currentIndex - 1] = array[currentIndex]
                array[currentIndex] = temp
                # save the index that was modified
                lastModifiedIndex = currentIndex
            currentIndex += 1
            # save the last modified index so we know not to iterate past it since all proceeding values are sorted
        n = lastModifiedIndex
    return n</code></pre>
<p>Now I wouldn’t call this bad except it was required in the 9th week
of the module - at this time, people still barely knew how to define a
variable.</p>
</div>
<div id="cem-1" class="section level3">
<h3>4067CEM</h3>
<p>Software Design is the module that describes the different
fundamentals about software design - mainly Object Oriented Programming
(OOP), development and management. We had used different tools to learn
about the different software development frameworks to maintaining it,
agile and scrum frameworks using Microsoft Azure (we had a live
demonstration about this a lecture hall one day). I personally didn’t
like this module however I had learnt some valuable team building skills
in this module.</p>
</div>
<div id="cem-2" class="section level3">
<h3>4068CEM</h3>
<p>Mathematics for Computer Science is the module I am so glad I passed
first time. I hated this more than the prior software design module. The
mathematics is a nice skill set to learn as this the way that computers
process and how programming languages work. At the start of this module,
it was all over the place as we initially started on “counting” then we
jumped into the more higher level of mathematics. To start it off, we
had to learn set theory; logic such as truth tables and the act of
proving if x == y and vice versa. We all needed to do it, but this was a
lot to do straight away. Here is an example of one of the questions I
had in the first mathematics examination:</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/maths_question.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="cem-3" class="section level3">
<h3>4071CEM</h3>
<p>Activity Led Computer Science Project 1 is a module that allows us to
use all that we have been learning in the other modules of this semester
to let us all show our knowledge of what we know. The brief of this
module:</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/activity_led_1.png" /></p>
<p>This doesn’t seem all bad, but I had fufilled the entirety of the
brief and only had gotten 40% out of the full 100%. Check my <a
href="https://github.com/tarannagra/past-uni-work/tree/main/Year%201/Semester%201/4071CEM">code</a>
and you can be the judge and see what grade I deserved.</p>
<p>In addition to the code, we also had to make a PowerPoint
presentation about the project as a whole which went not the best this
time around. I had thankfully just been lucky and passed both of
these.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="semester-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Semester 2</h2>
<hr />
<div id="cem-4" class="section level3">
<h3>4003CEM</h3>
<p>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is the module that allows us to
build from our software design module where we had learnt the
fundamentals of OOP and the bare understanding of Python in <a
href="#cem">4000CEM</a>. In this module however, we had done C++ instead
of the continuation of Python. The assessment for this was also closed
book, meaning that we couldn’t do it elsewhere and only under
supervision in the classroom. I had actually preferred this over with
other people as I could concentrate well and get my work done in silence
bar the mouse clicks around the room. Luckily I had passed both closed
book examinations first time, thanks to me learning the language the way
I tend to learn most things in life, making a massive repo about it. <a
href="https://github.com/tarannagra/past-uni-work/tree/main/Year%201/Semester%202/4003CEM-Exam-Practise">Click
here to view it, there is a lot there.</a>. Fun fact about this: I
learnt all of that within 2 weeks and passed first time while also
getting a 1st in both exams.</p>
</div>
<div id="cem-5" class="section level3">
<h3>4004CEM</h3>
<p>Computer Architecture and Networks is the module that gives us the
understanding of the development of a computer system and its major
components (CPU, motherboard, RAM, GPU etc…). On the first couple
lessons we had learnt different number systems which was good and so
good that every number I had looked at afterwards, I was imagining it in
Base-2 (Binary) and then in Base-10 (0-9 integers). In this module we
had some simple theory which we in turn then answered questions based on
what we had learnt in the lessons as the final tests. I am glad to say
that I had passed this module successfully.</p>
</div>
<div id="cem-6" class="section level3">
<h3>4005CEM</h3>
<p>Database Systems is the module which gives us the understaning about
how SQL (Structured Query Language) can be used to create a database and
insert and manage records while maintaining a good and healthy system
overall. I initially was excited to learn about this module, but in the
end I came to greatly despise it as there were many faults in my work
when I was making it. The assessment was split up into two different
sections, “Task 1” and “Task 2”. Task 1 was quite long and it gave us
the task to create a writeup and show the creation of the database
including the SQL commands. Task 2 gave the task to visualise the data
we had been given in Python. I am glad that we was told to do this in
Python and not in C++. <a

here to view the code for task 2.</a></p>
</div>
<div id="cem-7" class="section level3">
<h3>4075CEM</h3>
<p>Activity Led Computer Science Project 2 is the module that follows
from the previous one where we would show all what we had learnt in this
semester. And to match the previous programming language from last
semester’s class, this is no exception. We had to create a console based
game in C++. The brief of this is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/activity_led_2.png" /></p>
<p>This doesn’t seem that bad, but the lecturer who had assigned this to
us has mentioned that we <em>could</em> make our own game engine if we
wanted to do so. And so, me and my team went on and created one and made
a playable game in C++ on the command line. <a
href="https://github.com/tarannagra/past-uni-work/tree/main/Year%201/Semester%202/4075CEM">Here
is the code for this project.</a> <strong>Note: This was a group project
like the previous one hence the team memebers in the
README!</strong></p>
<p>Following the format of the previous activity led project in the
previous semester, we had to also create a PowerPoint presentation which
shows the design process alongside a <em>working</em> example of the
code working - we, like many others could only do so with images. This
time around, I actually did very well in both the presentation and the
code by scoring 60%-69% in the presentation and 40% in the code
averaging it out to 47% which is a pass :).</p>
</div>
<div id="a150ces" class="section level3">
<h3>A150CES</h3>
<p>Effective Communication Skills 1 is the module that introduces us to
some of the theories on inter-personal communication skills and help me
to evaluate the level of my communication ability. This is to prepare me
for a job in the future. This module also helped me to get the good
grade in <a href="#cem-7">4075CEM</a>. This was quite good actually and
even though we had half the sessions, I had managed to get quite a high
grade which I am very pleased with 62%. </p>
